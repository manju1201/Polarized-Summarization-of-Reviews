Polarized Extractive Summarization of Online Product Reviews

# Dataset
We have created a new sentiment classified dataset because the datasets available online are on complete reviews, and a review on a whole can not be given a single polarity because the review may contain both positive and negative aspects of user experience. With the goal of facilitating a more precise polarised summaries, we arepreparing a dataset containing sentence classifications as positive, negative, and neutral.
